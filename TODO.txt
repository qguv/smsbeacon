bugs:

- admins don't get notified when other admins directly blast
- "Sent by {} admin" is misleading because it was just approved, not sent
- admin banning self by number stays logged in and can even unban self

new features:

- get `process(...)` called: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41557956/can-you-trigger-an-aws-lambda-on-a-dynamic-timer
- soft migration test, old to new
- make web ui halfway decent
- more queueing options
- extensive api documentation
