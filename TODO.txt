bugs:

- admin reporting over SMS causes undelivered(?) messages (500 on callback?)
- **untested fix in:** admins don't get texted when other admins directly blast
- callbacks have 400 errors and don't send error codes but appear to work anyway??!

tasks before deploy:

- don't show plivo api keys on the page; pull them into the update only if they're nonblank
- get `process(...)` called: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41557956/can-you-trigger-an-aws-lambda-on-a-dynamic-timer
- automatically update plivo application url?
- serve static files statically
  - favicon
  - landing
  - and then do all of this through sls
- use RDS database
- user testing at hackrva
- soft migration test, old to new
- DEPLOY AND REPLACE v1

task after deploy:

- set sls up to provision api gateway, rds, and maaaaybe custom url
  - qa environment and prod environment
- extensive api documentation
- more queueing options
- make web ui halfway decent
