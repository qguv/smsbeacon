bugs:

- callbacks have 400 errors and don't send error codes but appear to work anyway??!

tasks before deploy:

- retry SMS sending when using XML responses too; unify XML responses and API calls
- don't show subscriber list on the page; bans happen only through submitted reports or manually
- don't show plivo api keys on the page; pull them into the update only if they're nonblank
- soft migration test, old to new
- DEPLOY AND REPLACE v1

tasks after deploy:

- can we automatically update plivo application url?
- serve static files statically
  - favicon
  - landing
  - and then do all of this through sls / gateway
- use SQS rather than process()
- admin_pending_was_subscribed and admin_pending_wasnt_subscribed UserTypes
- set sls up to provision api gateway, rds, and maaaaybe custom url
  - qa environment and prod environment
- extensive documentation
- more queueing options
- make web ui halfway decent
